**Classification of Vegetation Types Using Time Series Satellite Imagery**

This project focuses on classifying vegetation types or land use on a piece of land by analyzing time series data from satellite imagery. The goal is to identify and categorize different types of vegetation or crops based on the observed patterns over time.

**Introduction**

Satellite imagery is a valuable source for monitoring land use and vegetation patterns over time. By analyzing time series data, it is possible to detect changes and classify different types of land cover. This project uses machine learning techniques to classify vegetation types based on the temporal patterns in satellite imagery.

**Objectives**
- Classify the vegetation or land use on a piece of land.
- Analyze time series data from satellite imagery for patterns in vegetation growth or land cover changes.
- Develop a machine learning model to accurately classify different types of vegetation.

**Methodology**
- Data Collection: Obtain satellite imagery time series data for the area of interest. Potential sources include NASA, ESA, or other remote sensing organizations.
- Preprocessing: Prepare the imagery by performing steps like cloud removal, normalization, and time series alignment.
- Feature Extraction: Extract features such as vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, EVI) or spectral bands.
- Model Training: Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Neural Network) to classify vegetation types.
- Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization: Provide visualizations of the classified regions.

**Data**

The data used in this project consists of satellite imagery time series form sentinel-2. Possible sources:
    - Landsat
    - MODIS
